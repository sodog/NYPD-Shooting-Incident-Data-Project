## Statements of the question of interest

## In this report, We want to know which Borough has the most Shooting Incidents, Then will breakdown this per year, per Borough and per victim sex. 
## This will help us Understand the incidents Trends better. 
## For living and Being from Brooklyn, I would like to Analyze the data to understand further in which months the Incidents happen the most. 
## We will Then Build a logistic regression model to predict the probability of a shooting incident being fatal.

## CONCLUSION 
 We tried in this analysis to understand what happens in the data by borough and we noticed that despite whatever borough we take, the number of incidents are really high in the month of July and August. That's where my first bias occured by trying to figure out the trends in Brooklyn. We discovered that most of the victims where male and the data in Brooklyn mirror the entire data of New York City. We went on, trying to create a logistic regression to understand how often shooting can be deadly. With the column of STATISTICAL_MURDER_FLAG, that we converted in numeric 1 and 0, we build a model that can predict the probability of an actual fatal shooting occuring. We finalize by graphing the actual outcome. The last graph is showing our distribution plot.
